	In the Oxford dictionary learning is defined as
	\begin{quote}
		The acquisition of knowledge or skills through study, experience, or being taught.
	\end{quote}
	
	This definition is based on a very human way of understanding learning, as it groups the concept of skills and knowledge together.
	However acquiring skills often means to train or practice such that one is efficient. For instance, an archer may learn to be better at hitting targets, 
	not through gaining some new understanding of archery but rather by doing it repeatedly until he has sufficiently built up his muscle memory.
	While from a human perspective this makes sense as a form of learning, 
	it does not make sense in a logical view of learning, as it is just an optimization of the access time of the knowledge the person has about the subject.
    Therefore, we will ignore the notion of ``skills'' and distill the definition to that \textbf{Learning is the acquisition of knowledge}.
    
    Although this definition may be sufficient, it is represented --- in its most extreme interpretation --- as an agent that simply remembers all observed state transitions and is able to recall them in an identical situation. The intractability of this solution can be relieved by combining observations using probabilistics, thus gaining an approximate understanding of the domain. In contrast, we will focus on learning yielding perfect predictability, such that knowledge of the domain is proven to be correct.

\section{Defining learning}
	
	In~\cite{Walsh2008}, two learning algorithms are presented, an optimistic and a pessimistic one.
    In the optimistic algorithm, the learning agent believes it is able to solve any problem, unless it can explicitly prove otherwise. In contrast, the learning agent in the pessimistic algorithm only assume it can solve a problem if it has decidedly proven so, or if an external entity has provided it with a solution. 

A natural question in this context is, why is it necessary to define approaches to learning, such as the optimistic and pessimistic ones? Is learning not a universal concept? The answer is that while the acquisition of knowledge in itself remains the same no matter the approach, there are multiple approaches to getting into a situation where new knowledge is available. The frequency with which new knowledge is obtained, and the relevance of said knowledge relies heavily on the approach taken.

\begin{example}
    Consider two programmers tasked with implementing a complicated animation. Both know the programming language $J$, but have no experience with graphics programming. Programmer $A$ implements the animation in language $J$, complementing his existing knowledge with books and tutorials only when in doubt. Programmer $B$ takes a different approach, trying out several different languages and methodologies before finally discovering that language $H$ is the most usable for his needs. By focusing his learning on the graphics element, $A$ is able to quickly and efficiently solve the task. $B$ has solved the task more elegantly, and has obtained knowledge which may be relevant in similar programming tasks, but has taken considerably longer.
\end{example}

	These approaches are what~\cite{tobias1990a} defines as a Learning strategy:
	
\begin{quote}
	A learning strategy is a sequence of procedures for accomplishing learning.
\end{quote}
	
	This does not require that an agent must know the full sequence in order to have a strategy but rather that a strategy defines what procedure an agent must take for any given situation.

	Now that we have established that strategies are necessary to accommodate learning, we must turn our attention to the more important aspect of learning. 
	The acquisition of knowledge itself, all knowledge an agent has can be placed into three categories: proven knowledge, disproved knowledge and unproven knowledge. 
	The proven knowledge is knowledge that the agent has proven to be correct, disproved knowledge is knowledge which has been shown to be incorrect, and unproven knowledge is knowledge which has neither been proved nor has it been disproved.
	In science the prevailing method for acquiring knowledge has been through what we know today as the scientific method. 
	As such we propose that the scientific method is equally valid for acquiring of knowledge for an agent.
