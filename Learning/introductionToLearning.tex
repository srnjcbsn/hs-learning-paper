	Learning is defined by the Oxford dictionary as 
	\begin{quote}
		The acquisition of knowledge or skills through study, experience, or being taught.
	\end{quote}
	
	This definition is based on a very human way of understanding learning, as it groups the concept of skills and knowledge together.
	However acquiring skills often means to train or practice such that one is efficient. For instance a driver may learn to be better at operating his vehicle, not through realizing some but rather by doing it repeatedly until he has built his muscle memory.
	Such learning in a purely logical sense is what we will define as learning but rather just an optimization of the access time of the knowledge.
	Therefore we will keep to the notion that \textbf{Learning is the acquisition of knowledge}.
	
	The foundation for this thesis is based on the article \cite{Walsh2008},
