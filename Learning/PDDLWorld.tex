In order to discuss learning we must define a model for the domain which we operate within. Thus we choose to use the generally accepted PDDL or Planning Domain Definition Language[Cite missing]. This section will give a minimal definition of PDDL, and provide context for syntax used in later chapter. We will also explain functions used in state manipulation such as the ground - and state-transition function.

PDDL is based on set-theoretic planning[Cite missing] popularized by the STRIPS language[Cite missing]. By default states in PDDL are based on closed-world-assumption, meaning if something is not defined in the state it is assumed to be false. Thus a state is set of predicates defining the properties of the objects in an environment which the agent currently operates.

\begin{definition} 
	State $S$ in PDDL is a set of grounded predicates $\{p(o_1,\dots,o_n) \mid  p \in \mathbb{P} \land \{o_1,\dots,o_n\} \subseteq \mathcal{O} \land p(o_1,\dots,o_n) = \texttt{TRUE}\}$. Where $\mathcal{O}$ is the set of all objects in the world, and $\mathbb{P}$ is the set of all predicates that can be used to describe the objects in the world.
\end{definition}

To change the state an agent must perform action on the state, in PDDL action schemas describes what changes the action will have to the state and under what conditions. 

	
	\begin{definition} 
		An action definition or action schema, defines how and when an action is to be applied. 
		
		$
		\begin{array}{ll}
		Action ~ schema ~ A: & \\
		
		\begin{array}{ll}
		Variables & = \{v_1,\dots,v_n\}			 \\  
		Pre	& = Goal Description(GD) \\
		Eff & = Effect(EFF) 
		\end{array}
		\end{array}$
		
		The BNF for GD and EFF is as follows:
		
	%DONT USE TABS on the following listing as it is directly affected by it
		\begin{lstlisting}
	<GD> -> (and <GD>*) 
	<GD> -> LITERAL
	
	<EFF> -> (and <EFF>*)
	<EFF> -> LITERAL
	
	<LITERAL> -> <predicate name> (TERM*)
	<LITERAL> -> (not <LITERAL>)
	
	<TERM> -> <object>
	<TERM> -> <variable>
		\end{lstlisting}
		
		The distinction between GD and EFF is important to PDDL action schemas to allow either to receive additional features without the other gaining the same.
	\end{definition}
	
In PDDL a set of action schemas, along with properties about always present objects and specifications of all Predicates are defined as a domain.

\begin{definition} A domain in PDDL, defines what predicates ca
	
$
\begin{array}{ll}
Domain ~ D: & \\

\begin{array}{ll}
Constants & = \{o_1,\dots,o_n\}			 \\  
Predicate-Specs = \mathbb{P} \\
Action-Specs & = A~set~of~action~schemas~avaiable~to~the~agent \\
\end{array}
\end{array}$
\end{definition}


	

Instanced action schemas are referred to mainly as just actions. Such actions contain the name of the action schema it is instanced from, and a list of objects that are to be mapped to its variables.
\begin{definition} 
	An action $A(o_1,\dots,o_n)$ explains how action schema $A$ is to be instanced. The mapping to variables works like normal function mappings. 
	
	$\sigma = \{ v_1 \mapsto o_1,\dots,v_n \mapsto o_n \}$.
\end{definition}


Predicates which contain Terms in its arguments are referred to as fluent predicates, while grounded predicates refer to predicates that only contain objects in its arguments. Given a mapping $\sigma$ from variables to objects any fluent predicate can become grounded.
\begin{definition} 
	Any fluent predicate be converted to a grounded predicate, by a applying a mapping $\sigma$ to each of its arguments. As such the \texttt{grond} function takes a predicate $P$ and a mapping $\sigma$
	
		$\texttt{ground}(P(x_1,\dots,x_n),\sigma) = P(\sigma(x_1),\dots,\sigma(x_n)$ where $P$ is the name of the predicate.
		
	If the mapping is given in context, I.E. there is an instanced action schema in context of the discussion, then the shorthand $\texttt{ground}(P)$ can be used.
\end{definition}


To explain how an action is applied to a state we define a State-Transition function in accordance with set-theoretic planning.


\begin{definition} 
	State-Transition function $\gamma$ takes two inputs a State $S$ and an Action $A$. Its exact definition is:

	$\gamma(S,A) \triangleq 
	\left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
		(S \setminus effect^-(A)) \cup effect^+(A) & \mbox{if } A~is~applicable~to~S  \\		
		undefined & otherwise 
	\end{array}
	\right.$ 
	
	where $effect^+$ are the positive changes, meaning the grounded predicates that are to be set \texttt{TRUE} in the new state $S'$. Conversely $effect^-$ are the negatives changes, which are the predicates to be set \texttt{FALSE} in $S'$. 
\end{definition}

Furthermore, we define a single Transition as follows:

\begin{definition} 
	Transition $T$ refers to a triple (S,A,S'), where S is the original state, A is the action that was used on S and S' is the resulting state.
\end{definition}

Lastly in order for an action to know its purpose when planning it must have a defined goal. Such a goal is defined within what PDDL refers to as a problem.

\begin{definition} 
	$
	\begin{array}{ll}
	Action ~ schema ~ A: & \\
	
	\begin{array}{ll}
	Variables & = \{v_1,\dots,v_n\}			 \\  
	Pre	& = Goal Description(GD) \\
	Eff & = Effect(EFF) 
	\end{array}
	\end{array}$
\end{definition}

Given this machinery an agent is capable of modelling  definition actions and their e
