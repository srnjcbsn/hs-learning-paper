  TITLE={PDDL - The Planning Domain Definition Language},
  INSTITUTION={Yale Center for Computational Vision and Control,},
  NUMBER={TR-98-003},
  YEAR={1998},
  ABSTRACT={This manual describes the syntax of PDDL, the Planning Domain Definition
     Language, the problem-specification language for the AIPS-98 planning competition.
     The language has roughly the the expressiveness of Pednault’s ADL for
     propositions, and roughly the expressiveness of UMCP for actions. Our hope
     is to encourage empirical evaluation of planner performance, and development
     of standard sets of problems all in comparable notations.}

@article{Walsh2008,
abstract = {This work addresses the problem of efficiently learning action schemas using a bounded number of samples (interactions with the environment). We consider schemas in two languages— traditional STRIPS, and a new language$\backslash$nSTRIPS+WS that extends STRIPS to allow for the creation of new objects when an action is executed. This modification$\backslash$nallows STRIPS+WS to model web services and can be used to describe web-service composition (planning) problems. We show that general STRIPS operators cannot be efficiently learned through raw experience, though restricting$\backslash$nthe size of action preconditions yields a positive result. We then show that efficient learning is possible without this restriction if an agent has access to a “teacher” that can provide solution traces on demand. We adapt this learning algorithm to efficiently learn web-service descriptions in STRIPS+WS.},

@masterthesis{BS2011,
abstract = {This thesis focuses on covering missing academic theory in PDDL. In order to keep scope the work covers only basic STRIPS and the PDDL extensions typing, equality, negative-preconditions and fluents. Quirks in the syntax is discussed and a formal semantic is produced. Applying heuristic extensions to PDDL is analysed and discussed. As a part of the work a generic progression planner is implemented, in order to test suggestions for heuristic extensions and planning techniques.},

It employs a resolution theorem prover to answer questions of particular models and uses means-ends analysis to guide it to the desired goal-satisfying model. "
