\cite{Walsh2008} presents an algorithm for learning effects of action schemas limited to non-conditional effects. In this section we will expand on that and generalize some of their concepts.
For any action schema it is common that only a small subset of $\lits$ are actually present in its effects, 
therefore we differentiate between them by defining whether we have proved or disproved them. 
Initially when a literal has yet to proved or disproved, we say that it is unproven. 
It then follows that if no literals are considered unproven then we have complete knowledge for the action schema's effects.


\begin{definition} 
	For an action schema $A$, we define the following sets of literals:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The set $\Pro$ contains the literals  $l \in \lits$ proven to be effects $A$.
		\item Conversely, $\Dsp$ is the set of literals disproven to be effects of $A$.
		\item Those literals that are neither in $\Pro$ nor in $\Dsp$ are said to be in the unproven set $\Up$.
	\end{itemize}
	For instance, if an action's effect can have the literals $\lits = \{p(x), \neg p(x)\}$, 
	then initially $\Up = \lits$, $\Pro = \emptyset$ and $\Dsp = \emptyset$. 
	If we then learn that $p(x)$ is an effect and $\neg p(x)$ is not, 
	our sets should by this definition be: $\Up = \emptyset$, $\Pro = \{p(x)\}$ and $\Dsp = \{\neg p(x)\}$. 
	
\end{definition}

For $\Pro$, $\Dsp$ and $\Up$ two important invariant holds.

\begin{invariant}[Mutual exclusivity]\label{inv:nca:mutual-ex}
	A literal $l \in \lits$ is either proven or disproven to be a precondition, or it is neither, i.e.\
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
	\Pro \cap \Dsp & = \emptyset  \\ 
	\Pro \cap \Up &= \emptyset \\
	\Dsp \cap \Up &= \emptyset
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
\end{invariant}

\begin{invariant}[Completeness]\label{inv:nca:completeness}
	The three sets completely describe $\lits$, i.e.\ 
	\begin{equation*}
	\Up \cup \Pro \cup \Dsp = \lits
	\end{equation*}
\end{invariant}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Disproving effects}
In order to prove or disprove the effects through a transition $(S,a,S')$ we must understand what occurs in a state transition.

When an action is successfully applied in a state $S$, the literals comprising its positive effects are grounded and added to $S$ to form $S'$. Similarly, its negative effects are grounded and removed from $S$. Therefore, we should be able to observe the effects of the action as the differences between $S$ to $S'$ i.e \geffects. For the special case that an atom is both in $S$ and $S'$ there are two distinct possibilities: either it is part of the effects of the action but was already part of $S$ or it was not an effect (see Figure \ref{fig:nca:venn-of-effects}). The same holds for atoms that are in neither $S$ nor $S'$.

To disprove atoms for a single transition we use the idea that grounded atoms which are not in $S'$ cannot be positive effects, and grounded atoms which are in $S'$ cannot be negative effects. 
This is logically sound and gives us the following theorem:

\begin{theorem}[Disproving effects]\label{thm:nca:disprove-effects}
	 Let $\left(S, a, S'\right)$ be a state transition. Then any grounded literal $l$ is disproven to be a positive effect if its grounded version is not in $S'$. Conversely, a negative literal is disproven to be an effect if its grounded version is in $S'$. This gives us the following function to get all disproved effects for a state transition result $S'$:	
	\begin{equation*}
		 \dsp(S') = \left\{
			p \mid p \in \lits \land \ground (p) \notin S'
			\right\} 
			\cup
			 \left\{
			\neg p \mid \neg p \in \lits \land \ground(p) \in S'
			\right\}
	\end{equation*}
\end{theorem}
	\begin{proof}[Proof by definition]
		Recall that $S'$ is the result of a union which include the grounded atom of an action $A$'s effects. Hence, it follows trivially that any atom $\ground(p) \notin S'$ can not have been an effect of action $A$ or it would by definition be in $S$.
	Likewise if a potential negative effect $\neg p$ is $\ground(p) \in S'$ then that could not have been a negative effect.
	\end{proof}
\begin{example}[disproving effects in \texttt{move-h}] \label{ex:nca:moveSucceeded-disproving-effects}
	In case the sokoban agent applies the action $\texttt{move-h}(t_1, t_2)$ in state $S_0$, the resulting state $S_1$ will have the visible effect that the sokoban relocated from $t_1$ to $t_2$. 
	For the definition of action $\texttt{move-h}$ see \Cref{sec:SokobanPDDL}.
	
	
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
		S_0 &=
		\left\{
		\begin{gathered}
			\texttt{sokobanAt}(t_1), \\
			\texttt{clear}(t_2),\\
			\texttt{hAdj}(t_1, t_2)	
		\end{gathered}
		\right\} \\
		S_1 &=
		\left\{
		\begin{gathered}
			\texttt{sokobanAt}(t_2), \\
			\texttt{clear}(t_1), \\
			\texttt{hAdj}(t_1, t_2)			
		\end{gathered}
		\right\} \\		
		\lits_{move-h} &= \left\{
		\begin{gathered}
			\texttt{sokobanAt}(to), \texttt{clear}(from), \\
			\texttt{vAdj}(from, to), \texttt{vAdj}(to, from), \\
			\texttt{vAdj}(from, from), \texttt{vAdj}(to, to), \\
			\texttt{hAdj}(from, from), \texttt{hAdj}(to, to), \\
			\texttt{at}(from, to), \texttt{at}(to, from), \\
			\texttt{goal}(from), \texttt{goal}(to)  \\
			\dots
		\end{gathered}
		\right\} \\
		\dsp(S_1) &= \left\{
		\begin{gathered}
			\neg \texttt{sokobanAt}(to), \\
			\neg \texttt{clear}(from), \\
			\neg \texttt{hAdj}(from, to), \\
			\dots \\
			\texttt{sokobanAt}(from), \\
			\texttt{clear}(to), \\
			\dots			
		\end{gathered}
		\right\}
		\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
We see that incorrect effects are correctly disproved, such as moving the sokoban back where it came from $\texttt{sokobanAt}(from)$.
\end{example}

\subsection{Proving effects}
In order to understand proving effects, we must understand how effects are generated based on the action schema.
The $\ground$ function is used to ground atoms from an action's effect. This is important since if we know what atom a grounded atom originated from, then that is a proof for that atom. This means that if a grounded atom $p \in \Delta S$ returns only one atom when $\invground$ is applied to it, i.e. $\invground(p(O_1,O_2)) = {p(x,y)}$ then that atom $p(x,y)$ has been proved. In other words if $\ground$ is injective then $\invground$ is single-valued and it can thus be applied to all grounded atoms in $\Delta S$ and that will prove all of their respective atoms.
Whether or not $\ground$ is injective depends on the arguments of the action (see Figure \ref*{fig:nca:ground-injectivity}).
This gives rise to the following lemma:
\begin{lemma}
If the arguments given to an action $A$ are all unique, then $\ground$ is injective, thereby making $\invground$ single-valued.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Consider an action schema $A\left(a_1, \dots, a_n\right)$ and two atoms 
    \begin{equation*}
        atom_1 = p\left(x_1, \dots, x_{|p|}\right)
    \end{equation*}
    and
    \begin{equation*}
       atom_2 = q\left(y_1, \dots, y_{|q|}\right)
    \end{equation*}
    where $\left\{ x_1, \dots, x_{|p|}\right\} \cup \left\{ y_1, \dots, y_{|q|}\right\} \subseteq \left\{a_1, \dots, a_n\right\}$. If $A$ is applied with unique objects $O_1, \dots, O_n$, 
    then $atom_1$ and $atom_2$ are grounded as $atom_1' = ground(atom_1, \sigma)$ and $atom_2' = ground(atom_2,\sigma)$, where $\sigma = \left[ a_1 \mapsto O_1, \dots, a_n \mapsto O_n \right]$.

    % Two atoms are different when either their variables or predicates are different. Consider two ungrounded atoms $p\left(x_1, \dots, x_{|p|}\right)$ and $q\left(y_1, \dots, y_{|q|}\right)$ where all parameters of the two atoms  and their groundings $p' = ground\left(p \right)$ and $q' = ground\left( q \right)$. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the two atoms have different predicates $p \neq q$ then (by definition) $atom_1' \neq atom_2'$
		
        \item If the two atoms have the same predicate $p = q$, then at least some of the parameters of $p$ and $q$ differ. I.e.\ there exists at least one $i$ such that $x_i \neq y_i$. Since all action arguments are different, $\sigma\left( x_i \right) \neq \sigma\left( y_i \right)$. Consequently, $atom_1' \neq atom_2'$.
		% \item If the $p_1(v_1,\dots,v_n)$ and  $p_2(v_1,\dots,v_n)$ variables are different
		% 	\begin{equation*}
		% 		v_{1,1} = v_{2,1} \land 
		% 		v_{1,2} = v_{2,2} \dots
		% 		v_{1,n-1} = v_{2,n-1} \land
		% 		v_{1,n} = v_{2,n}
		% 	\end{equation*} 		
		% and arguments to the action $A(arg_1,\dots,arg_n)$ are unique
		% 	\begin{equation*}
		% 	arg_i \neq arg_j ~ where~ i,j \in \{ 1 \dots n \}
		% 	\end{equation*} 
		%  
		% Then the result of grounding the atom will remain different even when each variable is mapped to an object, 
		% as all those objects are unique. 
		% Since $\ground$ is the function that performs mapping.
	\end{itemize}	
	Given that we only consider cases where action arguments are unique. 
	Then we have proved that $\ground$ can never output to the same grounded atom, for two different atoms. Therefore it must follow that $\ground$ is an injective function by definition.
\end{proof}

On a side note, this means it is preferable for an agent to try actions where the arguments to that action are all unique. 

If however only some of the arguments are unique, then we should still be able to prove some of the atoms, provided all other atoms that map from the same grounded atom have been disproved. We can do this by using our disproved set \Dsp, built from earlier transitions, to discard incorrect atoms. This gives us the following theorem: 

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:nca:prove-effects} For a state-transition $(S,a,S')$ with 
	\begin{equation*}
	\Delta S = \left(S' \setminus S\right) \cup \{\neg p \mid  p \in S \setminus S' \}
	\end{equation*}
	
	then, for all $p \in \geffects$, the following holds:
	
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If \invground is single-valued, then $\invground(p)$ is an effect of $A$.
        \item If \invground is multivalued but there is a single atom in $\invground(p)$ that have not previously been disproven to be an effect, then that atom is an effect.
    \end{itemize}

	% If $\invground$ is single-valued or it is multivalued but all except one output are disproven, then that the literal outputted by $\invground$ is proven to be an effect.
	We can write this as a function:
	
	\begin{equation*}
	\pro(\geffects,\Dsp) = 
	\left\{
		p' \mid 
				p \in \geffects \land 
				\invground(p) \setminus \Dsp = \{p'\}
		\right\}
	\end{equation*}
	where $\Dsp$ is the set of disproven literals that the agent already knows about.
\end{theorem}
	
\begin{proof}
    We prove the two cases described above:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $\invground$ is single-valued, then $\invground (p)$ is the only atom in $A$ that could have caused $p$ to occur in $S'$.
        \item If $\invground$ is multivalued, then it is generally not known which atom(s) caused $p$ to occur in $S'$. However, if all atoms except one in $\invground\left( p \right)$ have previously been disproven to be effect, then that single atom must be an effect. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{example}[Proving effects in \texttt{move-h}] \label{ex:nca:moveSucceeded-proving-effects}
	Consider the states $S_0$ and $S_1$ from Example~\ref{ex:nca:moveSucceeded-disproving-effects}. Then, $\geffects$ can be found as follows:
	
	\begin{equation*}
	\Delta S = \left\{
        \begin{gathered}
            \texttt{sokobanAt}(t_2), \\
            \texttt{clear}(t_1), \\
            \neg \texttt{clear}(t_2)		
        \end{gathered}
        \right\}
	\end{equation*}
And the known knowledge can be extracted as
    \begin{equation*}
        \pro(\Delta S) = \left\{
            \begin{gathered}
                \texttt{sokobanAt}(to), \\
                \texttt{clear}(from), \\
                \neg \texttt{clear}(to)		
            \end{gathered}
        \right\}
    \end{equation*}
	We see that effects are correctly proven. For example, the fact that the sokoban moves to a new location is correctly proved by $\texttt{sokobanAt}(to)$.
\end{example}
