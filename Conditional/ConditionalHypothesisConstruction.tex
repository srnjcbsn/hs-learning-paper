Unsurprisingly hypothesis construction of conditional actions is very similar to that of non-conditional actions. 


\subsection{Optimistic Strategy}
Constructing the optimistic strategy as we recall has the traits \texttt{Explorative} and \texttt{Self-sufficient}.
To accomplish these traits we must do exactly as we did in hypothesis construction for non-conditional actions, 
except with the twist that we have to use unproven preconditions that are necessary to reach the candidates.
This is because candidate vertices are actually an efficient way to express connecting paths, 
but when we convert them back into preconditions we have to unpack their connecting paths.
However since we know connecting paths are intractable we cannot simply extract those and then use them to plan with, instead we have to design the  


The difference is that because preconditions are seen as a hypergraph representing all the unproven preconditions, 
then it follows that candidates in this context must be leaves connected the
