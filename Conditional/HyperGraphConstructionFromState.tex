<TODO: Include explanation of how proven effects are combined with the hypergraphs of the preconditions>

<TODO: Explain how there are many hypergraphs in one state, I.E. each effect contains its own hypergraph of preconditions>

Given a state transition $(s,a,s')$:

(TO Thomas this is a very condensed form of what will be written)
find all predicates in $\Delta s = s \setminus s'$. For each effect predicate, find predicates that are connected to it, and build a hypergraph from this information (after applying a substitution to reduce it to variable form). 

For each effect with the same predicate form (ie. $p(x,y)$ has the same form as $p(y,x)$, but not the same form as $p(x,x)$ or $q(x,y)$), merge their hyper graphs as described in the next section. 

Then merge the resulting hypergraphs with prior knowledge (which is also a hypergraph).
