This section provides ideas of how planning with hypergraphs can be accomplished and shows the necessary changes to the planner.

\subsection{Optimistic Strategy}



To overcome these problems we suggest to approach them from another angle, 
instead of trying to convert our knowledge to something that a planner can understand; 
why not instead extend the planner to understand what our knowledge means.
By this we mean: why not add functionality to the planner, that would allow us to use our hypergraphs directly when planning.
One important detail to know, is that to determine whether a candidate is satisfied in a state, we only need one simple path. 
As finding any path is solvable in polynomial time. 
This means that if we extend a planner to accept hypergraphs, that uses a search algorithm;
then we can achieve a running time that is $O(Search\texttt{-}Time \times \left| Objects \right|^k)$ where $k$ is arity of the effect. 
If we bound $k$ to a constant, as they suggest doing in \cite{Walsh2008}, then we can conclude our solution can run in polynomial time. 
The search algorithm would have to find any path in the state which is between the candidate vertex and a vertex that is in the same binding as the effect vertex, to determine what effects to add to the state; 
Furthermore, it is important to note that a lot of preprocessing can be done on the hypergraph before used for planning, thereby allowing for very efficient search algorithms. 
Additional improvement could also be achieved by filtering effects where no vertex exists that would bind it.

\begin{example} To understand planning using hypergraph let us provide the following example.
	Assume we have the candidate set shown in \Cref{fig:ca:hypgraph-with-cands}. And we have a state:
	
	\begin{equation*}
		S = \{ p(o_1,_o2), f(o_2,o_3) g(o_4,o_4), f(o_3,o_6), g(o_1,_2) \}
	\end{equation*}
	
	To find the effects we search from the candidates one at a time, mapping the bindings as we go forward.
	The first candidate $f_1$ has two nodes:
	\begin{equation*}
		f_1 = o_3 ~ or ~ f_1 = 0_2
	\end{equation*}
	 As there exists no node $p_2 = o_3$, that search path is discontinued, and continuing the other gives us:
	 \begin{equation*}
		 p(o_1,o_2) \rightarrow q(o_1)
	 \end{equation*}
	 We then do the same for $g$ but as some of the effects are already found we need not search for those, limiting us to only:
	 \begin{equation*}
		 g(o_4,o_4) \rightarrow q(o_4)
	 \end{equation*}
	 
	 As such we get the effects: $q(o_1)\land q(o_4)$, which are the correct effects.
	 It is important to note that if have we had multiple candidate sets then those would have to be intersected with each other. 
	 However even that aspect might have a more efficient solution.
	
\end{example}

\subsection{Pessimistic Strategy}

While the optimistic strategy was very hard to achieve, the pessimistic is surprisingly easy, we recall from \Cref{sec:NC:hypcon} that to make a pessimistic action schema it is only necessary to plan using only unproven preconditions. Since our hypergraph is a model of all our unproven preconditions then we need only convert it into predicates and use them in a conjunction, after which the planner should be able to handle the rest.


\begin{example} To construct a pessimistic action schema based on a hypergraph, the vertices and edges must be turned into predicate logic.
	In \Cref{fig:ca:hypgraph-with-unproven} we see a hypergraph of our unproven preconditions for a conditional effect $q$.
	Using the same approach shown in \Cref{ex:ca:hyp-paths}, we map each binding to a variable and combine the predicate edges' vertices into predicates.
	As such our pessimistic effect will be the following:
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}	
	Effect&: \forall_{(x,y,z,i)} ~q(x)~ when~ g(x,z) \land p(x,y) \land f(y,i)
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}	
	As we proved in \Cref{thm:ca:precondition-state}, this action schema will only produce the exact same effects as was produced when the agent observed them. Therefore the action schema is pessimistic.
\end{example}
