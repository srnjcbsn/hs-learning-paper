\chapter{Preface}

This thesis was prepared at DTU Compute in fulfilment of the requirements for acquiring an M.Sc. in Engineering.

This thesis focus on non-conditional and conditional action schema learning.
It extends the work of \cite{Walsh2008}, but also uses ideas from the scientific method which has evolved through many greek philosophers, and we have been heavily inspired by the works of \cite{popper1959a}.

This thesis will provide a proposal about a general agent learning algorithm, a complete a analysis of non-conditional action learning; and a framework and framing of the problems with conditional action learning, and provide initial proposals a solution.
